# Data

This project does not use an external dataset. All inputs are generated in code inside the notebooks and modules.

If you later add real data:
- Place raw inputs under this folder.
- Avoid committing large files to GitHub. Consider a download script or a link.
- Document any preprocessing steps in the relevant notebook.
